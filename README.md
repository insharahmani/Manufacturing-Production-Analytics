# 🏢 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project  

Welcome to my **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! 🚀  
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data warehousing and analytics workflow — from raw data ingestion to business-ready insights. It reflects best practices in **Data Engineering**, **ETL Design**, **Data Modeling**, and **Analytics**.  

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture  

The project follows the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, and Gold Layers) to ensure scalability, quality, and structured data flow.  

### 🔹 Bronze Layer  
- Stores raw data from multiple source systems (CSV files).  
- Data is ingested into **SQL Server** without any transformation.  

### 🔸 Silver Layer  
- Performs data cleaning, standardization, and transformation.  
- Ensures accurate and consistent datasets ready for analytics.  

### 🟡 Gold Layer  
- Contains business-ready data modeled in a **Star Schema**.  
- Optimized for BI tools, dashboards, and analytical queries.

## 🚀 Project Objectives  

### 🏗️ 1. Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering Phase)  
**Goal:** Create a centralized SQL Server data warehouse that consolidates sales and customer data for analytics.  

**Key Steps:**  
- Load data from **ERP** and **CRM** systems (CSV format).  
- Perform **data cleaning and transformation** for consistency.  
- Integrate both datasets into a unified analytical model.  
- Design and document **data architecture** and schema flow.  

---

### 📈 2. Business Intelligence & Analytics (Data Analysis Phase)  
**Goal:** Deliver SQL-based insights that drive business understanding.  

**Focus Areas:**  
- Customer purchasing behavior  
- Product sales performance  
- Sales growth and trends over time  

These analyses help stakeholders make data-driven business decisions.
